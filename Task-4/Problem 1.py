a=input("Enter First Number: ")      # input of first number
b=input("Enter Second Number: ")     # input of second number
Sum= int(a)+int(b)                   # Finding sum
print("Sum= " + str(Sum))            # Printing Sum. Here Sum is changed into a string because Sum is a int And hence cannot be concatenated with a string
